# -Quantum Trace LLM Observation Platform
---
>This project aims to provide enterprises and developers with a large model evaluation system and open platform, establish scientific, fair, and open evaluation benchmarks and methods, assist in quantifying performance, safety, fairness, and reliability, and help users effectively identify and mitigate potential risks and performance biases in applications.

>The platform designs and implements three main modules—question bank module, test module, and leaderboard display module—starting from the core goals of "big model testing," test module, result presentation, and comparative analysis. It constructs a complete model observation loop.

>Now,let me show you how to use the platform.
